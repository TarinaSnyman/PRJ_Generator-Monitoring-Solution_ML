# IoT-Based Generator Monitoring Solution Using AI

This repository focuses on the **machine learning components** of an IoT-based generator monitoring system. The goal is to improve generator reliability, reduce downtime, and lower maintenance costs through predictive insights.

---

## Project Overview
Backup power generators are critical but often suffer from unplanned failures due to poor monitoring. This solution integrates **IoT sensors** with **AI-powered predictive maintenance** to provide real-time insights into generator performance, fuel consumption, and potential failures.

---

## Key Objectives (ML-Centric)
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Develop machine learning models to forecast failures and optimise maintenance schedules.  
- **Anomaly Detection**: Use ML to identify unusual behaviour in generator data (fuel usage, vibration, temperature).  
- **Efficiency Optimisation**: Apply data-driven models to improve fuel usage and reduce operational costs.

## Methodology (ML Side)
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – use historical data form IoT sensors (fuel level, temperature, vibration).  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Extract meaningful signals for predictive modelling.  
3. **Model Development** – Train and evaluate ML algorithms for predictive maintenance and anomaly detection.  
4. **Deployment** – Integrate ML models into a cloud-based dashboard for real-time monitoring and alerts.  
5. **Evaluation** – Validate model performance in controlled environments before scaling.
